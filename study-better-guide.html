    <h1>How to Study Better: Complete Guide for Students</h1>
    <p class="hero-subtitle">
      Studying better is not about grinding longer hours. It’s about understanding how your brain learns and matching your habits to that.

      <h2>1. Focus on understanding, not memorizing</h2>
      <p>
        Start each topic by asking: “What is this really about?” Try to explain the concept in your own words, even if it feels messy at first.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use the Feynman technique: pretend you’re explaining it to a friend who knows nothing. Where you get stuck, that’s where you need to review.

      <h2>2. Use spaced repetition, not cramming</h2>
      <p>
        Instead of reading the same notes the night before an exam, review smaller chunks over many days. Your brain keeps what it sees repeatedly.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Day 1: Learn and summarize.</li>
        <li>Day 2: Quick review + a few questions.</li>
        <li>Day 4: Another short review.</li>
        <li>Day 7+: Only test yourself with questions.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>3. Keep your routine light but consistent</h2>
      <p>
        Two focused hours most days beat one chaotic 8-hour study day. Decide how many days per week you can realistically commit, then protect that time.
