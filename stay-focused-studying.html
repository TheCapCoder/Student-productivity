    <h1>How to Stay Focused While Studying</h1>
    <p class="hero-subtitle">
      Focus isn’t just willpower. It’s the result of how you set up your environment, your session length, and what you allow to interrupt you.

      <h2>1. Short focused blocks beat marathon sessions</h2>
      <p>
        Aim for 25–40 minutes of focused work followed by a 5–10 minute break. During the focus block, you only work on one task.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Remove obvious distractions before you start</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Put your phone in another room, or at least out of reach.</li>
        <li>Close all tabs that are not related to the task.</li>
        <li>Tell people around you you’ll be busy for the next 30 minutes.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>3. Create a “start ritual”</h2>
      <p>
        Do the same small sequence before every study session: water, open notes, write your first task on paper. This trains your brain to recognize “it’s time to focus now.”
