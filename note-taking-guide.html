    <p class="hero-subtitle">
      Good notes are not pretty — they are useful. They should help you understand ideas quickly when you come back to them.
    </p>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Capture key ideas, not every word</h2>
      <p>Listen for definitions, examples, and “this is important” signals from teachers. Summarize in your own words instead of writing every sentence.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Use structure (headings, bullets, arrows)</h2>
      <p>Group related ideas together. Use bullets, arrows, and headings to show connections. This makes revision much easier later.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Review your notes within 24 hours</h2>
      <p>Spend 5–15 minutes the same day underlining key points and writing questions in the margin. This simple step dramatically improves memory.</p>
